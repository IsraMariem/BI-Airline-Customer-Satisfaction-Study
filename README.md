--Enhancing Airline Customer Satisfaction--

This BI project conducts a thorough analysis of airline customer satisfaction and operations data,incorporating feedback from previous travelers and demographic information. 
Our primary goals are : 

1.Predicting Satisfaction:We aim to create predictive models to anticipate whether future customers will be satisfied with airline services. Using historical data and customer 
parameters, we enable airlines to tailor their services for exceptional passenger experiences.

2.Improvement Focus:Beyond predictions, we identify critical areas within airline services that demand attention. By analyzing factors such as travel type, class, seat comfort, 
flight distance, and delays, we empower airlines to strategically enhance the passenger journey and overall satisfaction.
